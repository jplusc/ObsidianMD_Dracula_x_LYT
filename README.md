# Dracula_x_LYT_x_EYE

Theme for Obsidian.

A tweak of 'Dracula_x_LYT' to help me with my color deficiency (added more contrast, etc)
- 'Dracula_x_LYT' was originally a mix of 'LYT Mode' and Dracula by xRyul 
- 'LYT Mode' is an awesome continuation of the Cybertron theme by ceciliamay

Original works:
- Dracula_x_LYT https://github.com/xRyul/ObsidianMD_Dracula_x_LYT
- LYT Mode https://github.com/nickmilo/LYT-Mode
- Cybertron theme https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron
- Dracula https://github.com/dracula/obsidian

## install:
1. Download the `obsidian.css` file
2. Rename the file to something like `Dracula_x_LYT_x_EYE.css`
3. Put the file in your vault's `/.obsidian/themes/` directory. (ie, maybe `j:\txt\.obsidian\themes`)
4. Select the theme via `Options` -> `Appearance` -> `Themes` -> `Manage`. It should take effect immediately.


## recommened fonts:
  - `Consolas` for text font  
  - `Anonymous Pro` for monospace font  
  
  (I know, they are both mono, i like that.)



## notes to myself:
  when working on themes:  
  turn on developer tools ctrl-shift-i  
  use pointer tool to see class and current color  
  'translucent windows' option threw me off. caused colors to render darker than what they were set as in css and showing as in developer tools  
  todo: find a nice sample .md file to show an updated screenshot.
